## System Flow

This project focuses on moving two UR5e robot arms smoothly and synchronously through four main stages:

- **Task Planning**: Define the robot's objective.
- **Path Planning**: Use camera input to determine movement direction. [More Info](https://github.com/peeradonmoke2002/FRA631_Project_Dual_arm_UR5_Calibration)
- **Trajectory Planning** *(Main Focus)*: Generate smooth waypoint-based motion paths.
- **Speed Control** *(Main Focus)*: Execute motion commands using low-level control like `speedJ` for safety and smoothness.

## Trajectory Concept

There are two primary spaces for motion planning:

![trajectory_concept](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/trajectory_concept.png)

### Task Space
- Plan motion in 3D space.
- Requires solving IK at each time step.
- High precision and obstacle-aware.

### Joint Space
- Solve IK only at waypoints.
- Interpolate motion directly between joint positions.
- Faster but less control over path.

|  | **Task Space** | **Joint Space** |
|---|---|---|
| **Advantages** | Predictable 3D motion<br>Obstacle avoidance | Faster execution<br>Smoother joint interpolation |
| **Disadvantages** | Computationally intensive<br>Unnatural joint behavior | Potentially unsafe motion paths |

**Chosen Approach**: **Task Space**
- Needed for high precision and obstacle awareness.
- Consistent with marker-based object detection.

## Trajectory Generation in Task Space

We use **Cubic Polynomial (3rd Order)** trajectory planning to ensure smooth motion:

```math
q(t) = a_3 t^3 + a_2 t^2 + a_1 t + a_0
```

- Allows defining both start and end positions and velocities.
- Coefficients `a_0` to `a_3` are computed based on boundary conditions.

### Flowchart
![flowchart_cubic_trajectory](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/flowchart_cubic_trajectory.png)

Before applying the cubic function, we calculate the total movement time:

![flowchart_time_gen_trajectory](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/flowchart_time_gen_trajectory.png)

### Time Calculation for Trajectory Planning

To calculate the total movement time using a trapezoidal velocity profile, we divide the motion into three phases:

1. **Acceleration Phase**:
```math
t_a = \frac{V_{max}}{a}
```
```math
d_a = \frac{1}{2} a t_a^2
```

2. **Deceleration Phase**:
```math
t_d = \frac{V_{max}}{a}
```
```math
d_d = \frac{1}{2} a t_d^2
```

3. **Constant Velocity Phase**:
```math
d_c = D - (d_a + d_d)
```
```math
t_c = \frac{d_c}{V_{max}}
```

**Total Time**:
```math
T = t_a + t_c + t_d
```

### Triangular Velocity Profile

If the total distance `D` is too short for the robot to reach `V_{max}`, the robot follows a **triangular velocity profile**. In this case:

- There is **no constant velocity phase**.
- The robot accelerates to a **peak velocity** `V_p` (less than `V_{max}`) and then immediately decelerates.
- The time to accelerate and decelerate is equal.

Let `t_p` be the time to reach `V_p`, and `a` be the acceleration:

```math
D = a t_p^2 \Rightarrow t_p = \sqrt{\frac{D}{a}}
```

```math
V_p = a t_p = \sqrt{a D}
```

**Total Time**:
```math
T = 2 t_p = 2 \sqrt{\frac{D}{a}}
```

These calculations are derived from the velocity-time diagram and uniformly accelerated motion equations.

Then, we generate trajectories for each axis:

## From TCP Waypoints to Joint Trajectory

After generating task-space waypoints, we use **Inverse Kinematics** to convert them to joint space:

![tcpwaypoint2Joint_trajectory](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/tcpwaypoint2Joint_trajectory.png)

- IK is solved at each TCP waypoint.
- Valid joint angles are added to the trajectory list.
- Failure in IK halts the motion plan for safety.

---

## Speed Control Concept

Real-time motion is achieved using the **Jacobian matrix**:

![jacobian_matrix_trajector](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/jacobian_matrix_trajectory.png)

```math
\dot{X} = J(\theta) \dot{\theta}
```
```math
\dot{\theta} = J^{-1}(\theta) \dot{X}
```

This enables us to convert desired end-effector speeds to joint speeds.

### Speed Control Flow
![speed_control_diagram](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/speed_control_diagram.png)

1. Generate trajectory using cubic polynomial.
2. Define desired linear velocity (angular = 0).
3. Use current joint state to compute Jacobian.
4. Invert Jacobian to get `\dot{\theta}`.
5. Send joint velocities using `speedJ`.
6. Repeat until full trajectory is executed.

## Step-by-Step Planning Process

> *This is a test planning step. The main project flow integrates Task Planning.*

1. Place ArUco marker boxes in the workspace:
![cam_capture_worksapce_trajectory](../images/trajectory_planning/doc/cam_capture_worksapce_trajectory.png)

2. Run the grasping script:
```bash
python move2object.py
```

3. The robot will:
- Move to the marker-defined box
- Grasp the box
- Return to home position
- Place the box back

The robot follows the **marker index order** to perform these actions.
