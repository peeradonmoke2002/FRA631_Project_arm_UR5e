bool speedJ(const std::vector<double> &qd, double acceleration = 0.5, double time = 0.0)¶
Joint speed - Accelerate linearly in joint space and continue with constant joint speed.

Parameters:
qd – joint speeds [rad/s]

acceleration – joint acceleration [rad/s^2] (of leading axis)

time – time [s] before the function returns (optional)

bool speedL(const std::vector<double> &xd, double acceleration = 0.25, double time = 0.0)¶
Tool speed - Accelerate linearly in Cartesian space and continue with constant tool speed.

The time t is optional;

Parameters:
xd – tool speed [m/s] (spatial vector)

acceleration – tool position acceleration [m/s^2]

time – time [s] before the function returns (optional)
